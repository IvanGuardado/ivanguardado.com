title: About me
---

I'm Iv√°n Guardado, a Software Engineer born in a Spain's small and beautiful region named Galicia, where people enjoy eating octopus, big steaks and drinking coffee liqueur.

I love **solving business problems** applying technology solutions in a smart and scalable way. I master a couple of programming languages but I consider them an additional tool to get my job done, focusing in which I consider are the important problems: well-crafted code, good communication and feedback.

Another different kind of challenge I love is to **help teams to apply technical changes**. Practices like Continous Delivery, TDD or Hexagonal Architecture are common to me and I try to spread them as much as posible inside the teams I work with.

In my spare time I enjoy practising sports like Crossfit and cooking. Healthy stylelife is my style :)
